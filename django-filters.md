To use Django Filters in a Django `ListView`, you'll need to integrate the `django-filter` package, which simplifies filtering queryset data based on the parameters provided in the URL or form. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Install `django-filter`
First, install the `django-filter` package using pip:

```bash
pip install django-filter
```

### 2. Update `settings.py`
In your `settings.py`, add `'django_filters'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps
    'django_filters',
]
```

### 3. Create a FilterSet
Next, create a `FilterSet` for your model. You can customize what fields can be filtered and how they are filtered.

For example, let's say you have a `Product` model with fields like `name`, `price`, and `category`. Create a filter class in your `filters.py` file (you may need to create this file in your app if it doesn't already exist):

```python
# filters.py
import django_filters
from .models import Product

class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = {
            'name': ['icontains'],  # Filter for partial match
            'price': ['gte', 'lte'],  # Filter for greater than or less than
            'category': ['exact'],  # Filter for exact match
        }
```

### 4. Integrate the FilterSet into the ListView
In your `views.py`, import the filter and use it in your `ListView`. You'll also need to use the `FilterView` mixin, which comes with the `django-filter` package.

```python
# views.py
from django_filters.views import FilterView
from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Product
from .filters import ProductFilter

class ProductListView(FilterView, ListView):
    model = Product
    template_name = 'product_list.html'  # Specify your template
    context_object_name = 'products'
    filterset_class = ProductFilter
```

### 5. Update your Template
In your `product_list.html`, you can render the filter form and display the filtered results. Use the form generated by the filter in the template:

```html
<!-- product_list.html -->
<form method="get">
    {{ filter.form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Filter</button>
</form>

<ul>
    {% for product in products %}
        <li>{{ product.name }} - {{ product.price }} - {{ product.category }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

### 6. URL Configuration
Ensure that your `urls.py` points to the `ProductListView`:

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import ProductListView

urlpatterns = [
    path('products/', ProductListView.as_view(), name='product-list'),
]
```

### Summary
- Install `django-filter`.
- Create a filter class for your model fields.
- Update your `ListView` to include `FilterView` and the `FilterSet`.
- Render the filter form in your template.

Now your `ProductListView` will allow filtering based on the fields specified in the filter set, with minimal boilerplate required.
